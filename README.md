# Welcome to Canada 3.0 Beta Test Version
Intro: After the outbreak started the survivors immediately started to notice that the infected are attracted to heat. After a few months, most of the world was infected and the only places left free of infection were the coldest areas on earth. Canada's prime minister opened the borders to any and all survivors seeking solace. Survivors came, the American and other military's of the world set up many base camps and for a while everything went back to normal. Then, the virus mutated. The infection broke out again. Now you are one of the last non infected humans in the world. 

about: Welcome to Canada is an original 7 days to die mod. You are spawned into the frozen northern wilderness of Canada and must survive the cold weather and many many Zeds. This mod focuses heavily on (what i would consider) more realistic crafting. Aside from crafting snow blocks, wooden club, and a few other recipes, EVERYTHING must be crafted in a workstation. No more crafting frames and arrows in your pocket while fighting zeds, now you must prepare before leaving home.



Download and Install: It is recommend that you use the 7d2d mod launcher to play this mod, you can find the mod in the mod list under "Welcome to Canada". If you are unable to use the mod launcher here is a direct download of the full mod.

Note: Due to the density of the forests, the amount of Zeds spawned, and the fact the zed bodies stay until you get rid of them, This mod can lean towards the resource heavy side of things. I find it runs smoother than some of the big mods out there but regardless, if you find you are experiencing lag then try turning your draw distance settings down in the options in game.

The Minibike and other Vehicles: Vehicles in Canada need to be warmed up before you drive them. Here are the instructions for the minibike:
- Hop on and turn on lights
- Hop off with lights still on
- count to 5
- Now your bike is warm, go man go!
