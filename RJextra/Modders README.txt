Hello fellow modder,

 Since you are reading this I am assuming you either want to learn from this mod or copy from it. Please do not copy any of my models or textures to your mod. I have worked very hard to keep Welcome to Canada an original mod that has things that other mods do not have. Again, please do not copy any of the models, textures or any other original medium. 

If you want to use this mod as an example then that is great and do not hesitate to message me with questions. You may also copy and use any of my coding that you like. I add the comment "RJ" in all coding so you can easily find my changes (for the most part). 

Thank You
Ryan James
