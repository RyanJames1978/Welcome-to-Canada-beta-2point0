Hello fellow modder,

 Since you are reading this I am assuming you either want to learn from this mod or copy from it. Please do not copy any of the models or textures to your mod. Many of the models are made by myself, sphereii, MANUX and some were even purchased assets specifically for this project. I own the legal rights to most of the models added, you do not. So again, please do not use any of these models unless otherwise instructed by me. Some of the models are free assets from the source engine and can be used by anyone, since you have no way of telling them apart don't risk it. For the most part, if i want the public to have access to these models then I will release a SDX mod for them. Check the forums. 

If you want to use this mod as an example then that is great and do not hesitate to message me with questions. You may also copy and use any of my coding that you like. I add the comment "RJ" in all coding so you can easily find my changes (for the most part). 

Thank You
Ryan James
