To install the easy mode please unzip and copy the file "spawning.xml" you see next to this text file.
Paste it into the main mod folder/Data/Config/.
Makes sure you "overwrite all"
That's it! Zombies now returned to vanilla spawning. 

Note: If you rent or own a server, both you and the server MUST have easy mode installed. Talk to your server admin.
