To install the easy mode please copy the folder "Data" you see next to this text file.
Paste it into the main mod folder where you see the original "Data" folder.
Makes sure you "overwrite all"
That's it! Zombies now returned to vanilla spawning. 

Note: If you rent or own a server, both you and the server MUST have easy mode installed. Talk to your server admin.
